  # KNN impute Algorithm
  # 
  # Some definitions:
  # Target gene: gene with missing entries.
  # Candidate genes: genes that are candidates to be the k-nearest neighbors
  # of the target gene.
  # 
  # Routine Details:
  # In a 1st round, the missing entries are estimated by row (gene) average.
  # Next, Niter rounds of KNN imputations are performed.
  # In each cycle, the set of candidate genes is composed by the last imputed
  # matrix. So the candidate set as the maximum possible dimension. 
  # 
  # If K is not given, before the KNN imputation, the optimum number of neighbors 
  # is determined automatically using estimateK
  # 
  # Additionally, all the missing entries of a given target gene are imputed
  # at once. Therefore, for each target gene, its missing experiments are
  # eliminated in the target and in the set of candidate genes. So, the
  # target gene and the set of candidate genes share the same dimension (i.e.
  # they have the same n of experiments).
  # Because of this the simple Euclidean distance can be used.
  # 
  # After selecting the k-nearest neighbors, the missing value is imputed
  # using a weighted average between these genes. The weights for each
  # K-nearest neighbor are given by:
  # wi = (1/di) / (sum of all di, with i=1,...,K)   
  # so each missing entry is determined by:
  #
  # ximputed = sum of wi * xi, with i=1,...,K  
  #  
  # INPUTS:
  # xmiss - matrix with missing values (NA values): p genes x n arrays
  # !! GENES IN ROWS  !!!
  # Niter - number of iterations to perform
  # K - (optional input) number of neighbors
  # e - convergence tolerance (default: 1e-3)
  #
  # OUTPUTS:
  # xcomplete -  complete matrix with missing entries estimated by IKNN (p genes x n arrays)
  # Kopt - number of neighbors (defined by the user or estimated automatically)
